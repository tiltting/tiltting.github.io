**Biography**  
Kayla Rooney is a meteorology major and is hoping to pursue an emergency management minor at Millersville University. She is from Warminster, PA where she was deathly afraid of thunderstorms growing up. As she got older, Kayla started to love going outside and watching the storms roll in over her house. This fascination has made her want to research supercells and tornadoes as well as the reaction time and preparedness of emergency alerts to the public. Outside of meteorology, she loves playing with her rabbits, singing and playing instruments (ukulele and piano), playing video games with friends, and spending time with family.

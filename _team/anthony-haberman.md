**Biography**
Anthony is from Baden PA. Ever since he could remember, Anthony has always had an extreme sense of curiosity for the complex dynamics that go on in our planet and especially in the atmosphere, which manifested into a passion for severe weather. He is currently focused on storm scale and tornado dynamics, as well as radar observations of convective storms. After graduating, Anthony plans to go attend graduate school, and earn his Master's and Ph.D. in meteorology. Outside of his passion for weather, Anthony is also interested in various other STEM fields, such as astrophysics, computer sciences and biology.

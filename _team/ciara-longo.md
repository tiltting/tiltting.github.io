**Biography**
Ciara Longo is a sophomore Meteorology major with an Environmental Hazards and Emergency Management minor at Millersville University. Ever since Ciara was a child, she knew she wanted to be a meteorologist. When she was little, she used to ask her parents to put on the weather instead of cartoons! Ciara grew up in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and chose Millersville to further her knowledge in the meteorological field. Ciara has always been fascinated with severe weather, so a big dream of hers is to storm chase. Something that Ciara values in life is helping people, so when she saw that project TILTTING not only was research, but something that could also save lives in the future, she was all for it. Weather is something that Ciara has always been passionate about, and she's ecstatic that she can finally achieve her dreams on such a team. Outside of weather, Ciara plays softball on the university's club team in her free time. She is an avid cat lover and has three cats with her boyfriend back home. She also enjoys watching TV shows and spending time with her friends and loved ones as well. Ciara is greatly looking forward to the experiences she will gain from project TILTTING.

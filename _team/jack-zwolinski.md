**Biography**  
Jack Zwolinski has always had a passion for severe weather, stemming from watching storms approach as a child from his hometown of Barrington, Rhode Island. Over the years, Jack has developed an extensive passion in severe weather, particularly tornado dynamics and the storm-scale mechanisms involved in tornadogenesis. In addition, Jack has been in cooperation with initiatives such as Western University's Northern Tornadoes Project in the emerging study of historical tornado detection via satellite imagery. After graduating, he plans on attending graduate school and earn his Master's and Ph.D. in Meteorology. Outside of weather, Jack is also passionate with music, college football, drawing, and historical geography.

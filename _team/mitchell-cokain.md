**Biography**  
  Mitchell Cokain is a third year meteorology major and journalism minor at Millersville University. His hometown is Leesburg, Virginia which was the founding place where he developed his love for weather. Mitchell ideally wants to end up on TV one day as a news meteorologist, but also is interested in an aviation or forecasting meteorology job. If there is ever a paid storm chasing position, expect to see his name at the top of the application list! Looking outside of meteorology, he loves to go to the gym, play football, video games, and loves to go on adventures. Even though Mitchell has not had a ton of hands-on experience with field work, he is beyond grateful and exhilarated to contribute and be apart of Project TILTTING.

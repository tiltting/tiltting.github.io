**Biography**  
Matt Muller, native to Folsom, Pennsylvania, discovered his passion for meteorology as a kindergartener scrolling through the 7-day forecast on his mother’s desktop. Now, as a second-year meteorology and mathematics major, he has begun to explore all sorts of meteorological phenomena, taking keen interests in climatology as well as cyclones of both tropical and non-tropical origin. Following his time at Millersville, he plans to attend graduate school to continue pursuing his zeal in the atmospheric sciences. Outside of the classroom, Matt is an avid women’s basketball enthusiast (go Fever!) who also enjoys keeping up with his garden and ever-growing collection of cooking recipes.

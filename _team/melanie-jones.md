**Biography**
Melanie (Mel) Jones is from Ebensburg, PA, where she grew up with her eyes glued to The Weather Channel and shows such as Storm Chasers. As she grew older, her fascination with weather transformed into a passion and a purpose. After she earns her bachelor's degree, Mel hopes to attend graduate school and earn her master’s degree in meteorology or a similar field. With her knowledge, she aspires to conduct research on supercells and tornadoes, and inform the public on severe weather phenomena to protect lives and property. Outside of meteorology, Mel enjoys spending time with loved ones, experiencing the outdoors through hikes or walks, travelling, and going to the gym.
